\usage{
launch_editor(
  ui_loc,
  host = "127.0.0.1",
  port = httpuv::randomPort(),
  shiny_background_port = httpuv::randomPort(),
  show_logs = TRUE,
  run_in_background = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ui_loc}{Path to the \code{ui.R} file containing the ui to be edited. If file
does not exist a default starter template will be used upon finishing will
be saved to the path.}

\item{host}{A string that is a valid IPv4 address that is owned by this
server, or \code{"0.0.0.0"} to listen on all IP addresses.}

\item{port}{A number or integer that indicates the server port that should be
listened on. Note that on most Unix-like systems including Linux and Mac OS
X, port numbers smaller than 1025 require root privileges.}

\item{shiny_background_port}{Port to launch the running app preview on. Again
only used for dev work.}

\item{show_logs}{Print status messages to the console? For debugging.}

\item{run_in_background}{Should the app run in a background process or block
the console? See \code{?httpuv::startServer()} vs \code{?httpuv::runServer()}. Note
that this potentially will result in orphaned Shiny processes because
there's no way to know when the user is done with the app preview. Use with
caution.}
}
\value{
A list containing the \verb{$server}: The app server object (as returned
by \code{httpuv::startServer}) and the function \verb{$stop()} for safely terminating
the server and preview shiny app.
}
\description{
Spins up an \code{httpuv} server that handles parsing and deparsing of the UI tree
and saving.

\details{
\subsection{Stopping server When running with \code{run_in_background = TRUE}, it's}{

recomended you use the \verb{$stop()} function in the returned list object instead
of the build in \verb{$stop()} function on the returned \verb{$server} object as this
will ensure the running Shiny app preview will also shutdown.
